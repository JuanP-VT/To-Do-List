# To Do List App

## What is this ?

This project is part of my **Curriculum Series**, the objective is to have a repository to prove my skills as a web developer.

As i keep getting deeper with javascript now I face the challenge to create cleaner code, the goal of this App is to begin to utilize modules and keep my code as tight as possible.

To help me create a bundle from my modules I started to utilize WebPack.

This app is a To Do List, basically you create projects to keep track of your activities, each activity can have details, importance, due date.
## Features:
- Create & delete projects that store tasks

- Mode to sort task by their importance

## Objective

- Learn to work in modules
- Practice clean code principles
- Get familiar with webpack
